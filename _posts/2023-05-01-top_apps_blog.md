Following are (some of) my favorite apps:

- [Urban Outfitters](#UO)
- [Venmo](#Venmo)
- [Starbucks](#starbucks)
- [Instagram](#Instagram)
- [Tiktok](#Tiktok)
- [eMoods](#eMoods)

### UO

Urban outfitters is my favorite store. I was so happy to discover that they have not one but I think three UO in Berlin. Its just the most 'feel good' place for me. Hashtag good vibes

But even better than the store is their app. I think the best thing about the app is the overall _Customer Delight_ aspect (or aesthetic, as the cool kids say it)

They also have rewards point and great ~Rabbats~ if you ask me

I think the most aestherically pleasing thing about the app is this geometric circle that tells you how many points have you acquired.

I guess I could have video/giphy recording the whole visual but I'm not THAT Indian(glass floor v/s glass ceiling)

### Venmo

Venmo is a cool app not only for money exchange but also to be able to do creative self-expression in the form of emoji and puns while you're paying people back.

Here are some examples:

But you also gotta be careful because these 'statuses' can get out of hand sometimes. Like passive aggressive vibes

### starbucks

Starbucks is a very wholesome app. They give you points and make you feel welcomed. Like imagine getting chai for your birthday for free with no side eye.

### Instagram

Instagram is a very cool app. An argument could be made that people use it just to 'seek validation' but for me its basically like digital scrapbooking. I 'story' all my concerts and travels. I also try to use it as a platform to raise awareness about mental health and stuff. Its a hit n miss and you can get called out but I feel as long as I am not harming anyone physically or something it should be fine? (I haven't gotten a hang of the whole punch up/punch down thing)

I think my bestie rambo hit the nail on the head when she unknowingly made a J Cole song reference when I asked to let me know if I ever need to 'censor' myself on there. She said the following (which is also a J Cole lyric)

### Tiktok

Tiktok is a very inclusive space especially when it comes to mental health and dating and stuff. Gen z is *100 emoji! if you ask me. Loving the #browntiktok as well (especially since Ambani crossover party)

But yeah coming back to mental health there are some really good open people out there (accounts by the name of BPDBrian, BipolarBarber, et al)
Not gonna lie some of the schizophrenia 'jokes' make me uncomfortable at times but more power to these people honestly.

### eMoods

I think this app has a very special place in my heart and I believe this is the only app I pay for. Its an app created by a bipolar person I believe. You can track your moods, meds, journal, etc.

There is also an option to create a 'safety plan' just in case you're struggling. (Basically things you need to remember/reread if the struggle level is too high)
