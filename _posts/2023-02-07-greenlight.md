Greenlight Planet is a solar product company I worked for remotely for a year-ish while living with parents in India in 2021.

Here's why they are cool:

### Solar products are cool-point blank.
Its renewable energy. Need I say more? (I could, but I gotta focus on my day job more than this blog lol)

### They care about *gender diversity* and *mental health*
They really do! There are recurring seminars on how to ensure gender parity. HR makes sure your mental well-being is good. They provide free therapy portal. (I tried, it didn't work for me in the long run and I'd much rather work with a private therapist but its not GLP's fault)

They also provided bereavement leave to a colleague of mine in Africa which I thought was impressive.

Or maybe my bar is too low lol, because like I have in past worked at places where I was called to work on a 'small thing' while on PTO(that I announced well in advance). Also when I asked this employer about dental(insurance), she gave me death stare(forget mental health support)

### Co-workers are supportive
If you are really involved in a project, you would get equally proportional support from your peers. I will never forget the kind of support I was given with complicated lag/lead functions while calculating the engagement of selling agents with the in-house app.

### Leaders Lead (lol, as they should, but you'd be surprised)
The leaders have well thought out projects laid out for you well in advance. I am talking- planning projects upto Q4-2024 in 2022. Also if you are uncomfortable and want to switch(departments/roles) or something they don't judge.

## They have free coursera courses
I think for the first month-ish at Greenlight I basically did numerous machine learning courses. Most companies _say_ they have L&D budget and what-not but GLP really comes through. Usually with other companies there is a glitch in actually getting to access said learning budget(technical issues, delays, et-al); but GLP makes it accessible almost instantly(as soon as you join)
