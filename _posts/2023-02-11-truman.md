I knew this is on track to becoming a series. So here's a second blog on Truman. WHy is it awesome?

More reasons...

Here we go...

# No Paradox of Choice

Since Kirksville is a very small college town, you only have a few options in terms of restaurants, bars coffee shops, etc. - and that's a good thing!(sometimes)

For example every the one(singular) bar we went to every Thursday for ALL YOU CAN DRINK was [_Dukuum_](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dukum-inn-kirksville). There were a few others but this is my favorite

Same goes with grocery shopping, restaurants(I will make a list of my favs shortly), and also there is only one thrift store. Very cool.

# Friends for life (also professors)

The friends I have made at Truman have proven to be great! They are my ride-or-die.

Here's a pic of me at my bestie's wedding. We still talk on the daily. She's my cheerleader.

Here's a tiktok about my another good friend Sujash. We also still talk. He's a ver talented poet and writer.

# Alumni Network

While I was in the Bay Area, I went to a Truman alum networking event. I still get emails from them. I just informed them that I am in Berlin now.
