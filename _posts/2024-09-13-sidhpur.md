Its no secret that Dharamshala/Mcleodganj is one of my favorite places on Earth. I have visited here for, idk, n times, where n seems to tend to ‚Üí ‚àû. But this was my first time doing a solo trip here which makes it special. 

[Here] ({{ site.baseurl }}/mcleodganj/) is a link to earlier Mcleodganj blog, when I went with my parents

India is not considered to be the safest place for female solo travelers and having lived in US for a large part of my life (all my 20s), I have simply not travelled to many places in my own country.

Even my recent Delhi/Gurgaon trip was a visit to a friend's house. 

But there is something about solo travel that is just so empowering and therapeutic
 for me and I just didn't want to wait until I am back in EU/US to go experience yeat another taste of complete independence and autonomy for a few days once again, but this time in my own country.  

The reason that solo travel is not _THAT_ popular or seen in as much of a positive light, especially in my culture/country is usually for, I assume, two reasons, **a) safety aspect** or **b) boredom/bechari/loner vibes**

For the first, I totally understand. I have also never travelled alone in India and my dad, for one, was scared when I simply announced that I am going to Sidhpur on my own. To that end I think what helps is sharing how [my airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/707312550600330911?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=091fbfee-d127-430d-84c4-b143a3f17154) is a superhost popular listing among female guests as well. 

Also as much as I'd wanted to fully disconnect and go off the grid, sending goofy selfies and replying to all the gifs with equally funny and cute gifs, reassures my parents that I am safe and having a lot of fun.

For example here was a cute interaction I had with my dad within 6 hours of leaving home (after recently having lived with my parents for an extended period of time, he is JUST starting to learn emojis/gifs):

Here are some more funny ones:

For the second aspect, the bechari/akeli/boredom reasons, I'd say,

***short answer***: to each their own ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

***Long answer***: I think solo travel is the most empowering thing a woman(or any person can do). I think the only people who shame/look down upon solo dining/traveling/anything are the ones who themselves can't be alone with their thoughts because that would mean coming to terms with some uncomfortable emotions and truths about ourselves, our past decisions, mistakes, our relationships, et al, - and not everyone is ready for that kind of introspection. 

And I am not just saying this as a snark to a _rishtedaar_ or a vigil- *auntie* who recently pitied me for being single. I myself used to distract myself with random noise(superficial friends, lukewarm connections, food, tv shows, etc) until I became comfortable with silence, solitude, and even boredom.

I feel we all should allow ourselves to be idle/bored for atleast a few hours as idling/dilly dallying often inspires a lot creativity, maybe even some epiphanies, and just the joy that comes from the _art of nothingness_ is unmatched.

I strongly recommend doing some solo me-time each day, if not a whole solo week or month.

Following is one of the guided journaling I did recently on this trip off of a book I read, that I recommend to everyone:

I also think there are so many ways to feel thoroughly entertained and extremely blissful, especially in a place like Mcleodganj. There are numerous places to trek/hike to, so many Buddhist temples to explore/meditate at, books to read, cafes to people watch in, street food and shopping to enjoy, museums and art workshops, this list is endless.

Also I have heard there are many cool bars to party at, just that, I am now a 10-pm-in-bed-chamomile-tea typa person

Why Sidhpur? Well, since I have been to Mcleodganj quite a lot of times and wanted to explore a new place. Also I wanted an experience wherein I sort of feel I am living like a local. Sidhpur is 30-40 mins away from Mclo but also close to the [***Norbulingka monastery***](https://india.norbulingka.org/?srsltid=AfmBOoqAN7Xrt_VkuSn0OYH8iLK4wP1ayVR3kQw0qe-1Kwd422ZUEpYX). 

So it gave me all the perks of practicing my Buddhism without that influx of tourists I'd constantly keep bumping into had I stayed in Mclo.


If you're looking for an exciting vacation with a litle flavor of Buddhist culture, I'd recommened staying in MClo. However if you're looking for a quiet getaway, away from the hustle and bustle of the city/touristy life whilst exploring mountains, Sidhpur is a cool place to be.
