Working for Girls Who Code in Atlanta was my first job outside of school. I had just graduated with my bachelors and moved to Atlanta to start this job. I did not know anyone, but living in Midtown was really fun and I became good friends with the teaching team. We learned many new things and went to a lot of field trips. It was a fun and inspiring summer!
