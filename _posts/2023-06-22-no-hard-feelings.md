No Hard Feelings is such a cute romcom starring Jennifer Lawrence (who is also the producer). Its a classic introvert-nerd-meets-ditsy-hot-girl movie. Percy's parents want his awkward(read: introvert) kid to come out of his shell prior to him going to college so that he can have a successful social life. While Jlaw's character is trying to get some quick cash/car(I don't recall because I resonated more with Percy). The parents hire JLaw to date their son.("date his brains out")

Jlaw goes to the dog shelter Percy volunteers at to seduce him. He is not impressed. Sure, he finds her physically attractive but her very much so cliche and played out charm tactics and choreography doesn't work for Percy because he is smarter than that. He infact ends up pepper spraying her at one point and accuses her of kidnapping him. 

They finally go on a real date and she tries to have sex with him but he says - “I’m not going to have sex with someone I don’t know...maybe not tonight, I am too much of a romantic". I have never felt more seen in a movie. Kids like Percy or anyone going to college usually have a lot of parental/societal/peer pressure to partake in generic funs(frat parties, random vague sex, alcohol to the point of poisoning). As someone who prefers 1-1 hangs (and I have also made it abundantly clear that I am more of a cannabis person ;), I simply never got any joy out of hollow/shallow group hangs - People that drink don’t understand that its pretty useless to be around sloppy sloppy drunk people. I am more like what CS majors would call a queue when it comes to social gatherings-FIRST IN FIRST OUT. I also related to him on the casual sex bit. More than the romantic aspect I again feel this is something I gain no joy out of. Confession: I have often yawned during any attempts of casual sex I have had in my life. I simply gain nothing. 

JLaw and Percy eventually end up getting closer in a more serious way when he sings a thoughtful song for her on a dinner date. He also takes her to a Princeton party.

I won't spoil the ending but I will say its a very cute movie. 

I also thought that after Covid (when everyone was low-key forced to be an introvert), introvert-shaming would have ended, but I feel solo stigma still persists. Percy's parents did that to him in this movie. And as for me, I am a 31yo Indian woman, so needless to say, I am reminded of my solitude/loner vibes a little too often.
