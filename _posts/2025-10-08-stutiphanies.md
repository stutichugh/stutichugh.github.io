Scribbled some in my notes app and calling it a blog. A one minute blog, if you will. Just some recent thought bubbles...

- Burnout fueled Procrastination reminds me of _everything-but-bagel_ seasoning from _Trader Joe's_ , I’ll do everthing _BUT_ the thing I need to get done. (Eg: I deep cleaned my fridge and mopped my bathroom floors once instead of taking a very easy timed test I had a deadline for)
- Winter depression is like wearing an invisible weighted vest. Sure, cozy flannels, christmas/diwali lights, and gooey cookies can bring it into a window of tolerance momentarily but someone please steal _this_ hoodie away from me - ughhh
- We should gauge the quality of a person/food/experience less off of how it makes us feel in the moment and more off of how it leaves us feeling (delayed gratification or delayed regret?) 
- Choosing wrong things due to societal pressure and optics is the real pandemic - solo time really helps u learn what u really want to do 
- Pursuing fitness is the real catch-22. You need stamina to build stamina, abstain from good foods to build natural dopamine - its all too delayed a gratification process for my recently reel scrolling brain
- Being a hyper independent lover girl is amusing - ask my notes app (***switches from limerence poetry to LLM coursera notes to company revenue dash back to mopey crushing in a span of minutes***)
- A playlist or mood board curated based on different eras of your life is fastest way to hack nostalgia into helping u revisit that version of yourself (my favorites - sophomore2k16, urbanoutifftersdiscoveryerachicago)
- After having tasted monetary success in 3 difference currencies(€,₹.$), I’d say none of them are as appealing as my newly discovered favority currency - time (or _fursat_ as I like to call it when feeling fancy)
