I promised to share some hot takes ocassionally on this blog but never followed through - Here's an attempt to make this a recurring series:

1. Doing hard things is not as hard as breaking inertia (eg: getting out of bed, writing that first line of code, picking up book from shelf)
2. Indian people problems <<<<<< Indian diaspora/nri problems (homesickness/visa begging >>>>> monsoon water logging)
3. Inconvenience is the price for connection/community
4. Microdosing discomfort throughout the day consistently for 30 days makes you into a completely new human in a month
5. Abroad should be/stay reduced to a single semester/vacay spot (read #2 again)
6. Turning hobby into a job is overrated (cue *Billie Eilish* _Getting Older_: 'things I once enjoyed, just keep me employed now')
7. A lot of us could benefit from Meta launching an Ad Free version of Instagram (Instagram Plus: no impulse shopping, just memories, creativity, and vibes)
8. Vulnerability is overrated. Most, if not all, humans have a tendency to capitalize on your weaknesses. Keep a Journal instead
9. Quick commerce platforms are the most innovative and customer centric launch by an Indian org
10. Mental Health movement stole away some of that old school grit and work ethic from millennials (who thought Iâ€™d be the one to say this, right?)
