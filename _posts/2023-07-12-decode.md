There is [***nothing left to decode***](https://open.spotify.com/track/17wMOhLqVB3DRCmTaLjwVM?si=74fc8d3f50b74f0e)...

[TLDR: tad personal blog/writing...a dating story]

I met a guy. I think I matched him for visa support/expat questions at the time because I had just gotten a job offer in Berlin and it was finally my time again to leave my boring hometown. Or maybe because him liking museums and wanting to read each exhibition plaque made me attracted to him.

We never met for over a year. Flip-flop-flip-flop b/w India and Berlin. He double, triple, quadruple texted and finally ‚Äòcome on a drug free date with me‚Äô is what got to me and broke him out of the clutter.

Up until us meeting I was still _‚Äòthe prize‚Äô_

He knew how to say all the right things. Dark humor within the first 10 mins of the date (being shot>being slapped)

I had a chance to touch his items, because we had to move seats at this bar until he went to get drinks, even though he never hugged me, moving his jacket alone gave me that warm fuzzy feeling (...women...intimacy...we‚Äôll take anything we can get)

Hugging a cactus is a hard thing to do anyways.

He poked fun of me for zooming out (instead of zooming in?) on google maps on 1 of the many different cities of our home country he claims to have lived in. Perhaps ashamed of his hometown? Not sure about this one.

We talked and talked. Banter is apparently his thing and I am good at providing that.

I shared my life with him. He listened. I was doing some things to just be cute but he took it as stupidity...(‚Äòyou seem like someone who doesn‚Äôt know this‚Äô)-yeah buddy, how would I know?, my boobs get in the way of me learning. (_Rachel Feinstein_ joke reference)

Coincidentally a random samosa boy showed up (on a date bw two desis)...I thought it was cute. I politely declined because I thought it was a part of his choreography. (Trust issues from the get go)

We talked and we laughed. He was humming when we were going to get food. I took it as a sign of him being interested. We talked more. Indian things, Expat things...things I haven‚Äôt talked about to someone in a while. It was nice.

And then he displayed his fat-phobia...I disregarded. Why?...because I liked him. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I wasn‚Äôt planning on liking this person...but it happened. Maybe I was homesick...or yearning for a like minded desi soul and fell into the delusion that I found one.

He disappeared after...

I made the move to tell him that I have been watching his fav comedian. He still acted uninterested and aloof but we did eventually meet.

I had a gut feeling that I should nip it in the bud with him(and told him that!) but he suddenly became available when he saw me slipping away from him.

I teased him by saying ‚Äòoh look! I bullied you into meeting me‚Äô- he said he isn‚Äôt bullied, but has some time management issues because he lived in India recently for a couple months and he can‚Äôt do his chores on his own. - _peak desi_

I nonetheless bought it and even provided a parallel story of how I also feel I undid the progress of living on my own in US for a decade by living in India for couple years right after. Making excuses for men‚Äôs flaky behavior is a toxic women trait that I know I need to get rid of for sure.

We got high, he thought idk what he is doing by interrogating me more and asking me all the right questions. The kind of questions I used to ask growing up when I had a crush on a boy in school. You know those long/end game questions...those very Indian questions...checking for wealth discrepancy, my exes, my relationship with my parents, et al. He perhaps even lied about matching with an asian girl in psychiatric care who asked him to bring food for him. Perhaps a test to see if I‚Äôd blurt out that yes!, even I have been to a psychiatric care unit. I didn‚Äôt take the bait. (Yes, I CAN keep some things to myself hehe.) He said he was interested to hear my stories...and I delivered.

He said he‚Äôd like to watch my fav comedian with me. Even if she may be too raunchy. I was tad impressed by his interest in me and my likings.

He was the one always brought up the dreaded M word. ‚ÄòWho do you want to marry‚Äù - he asked. I pointed to my _Seth Rogen_ poster. I flipped the question on him, and he aggressively said ‚Äúfor the next two years, NO ONE‚Äù. Just name a celebrity bruh, no one is trying to marry you without getting to know you. (Commitment phobic avoidant from the get go)

He acted super busy and aloof yet somehow super interested when I mention a different person who I matched with or got set up with.

Its almost as if he was only interested in me when he got an ultimatum or felt me slipping away from him...

I gave multiple outs but he took none of them...

Bro said he‚Äôd be spontaneous about the next hang...which unfortunately did happen...things happened...life stories were shared/exchanged...details that shouldn‚Äôt have been given were told. Some of it was helpful, some not.

He said patience is not my virtue but I had been patiently waiting for him all along but who will tell him that?

I said consistency and communication is not his virtue which is true because I still don‚Äôt know what ‚Äòmanaging my time‚Äô entails for him‚Ä¶he was super unclear‚Ä¶

He said he is dating other people but also said there are no girls in his life when we were saying parting words...

I understood that he just doesn‚Äôt see me as a good romantic fit for him for whatever reason.

Things should have ended there but I made yet another mistake. Struggling with my career, I decided to seek help from in a purely platonic expat-to-expat fashion. I admitted some mistakes and stayed quiet when he again pushed my boundaries.

He told me that if I can‚Äôt figure out my shit in corporate tech even after getting PR, he‚Äôd pay my bills/taxes(?)

That shit hurt...I have provided(and will continue to provide) for myself. It has been my thing since I was 20. I don‚Äôt even like bothering my parents for money even though I come from a little bit of privilege. 

Or was he insinuating I‚Äôd be his side chick he pays for? Or saying in 8 months he‚Äôd be ready to date me? Either way shitty thing to say/do.

We continued to talk because I still saw some good in him for some reason.

I shared my very genuine work struggles with him...

He continued to engage with both me and my ‚Äòstories‚Äô (both ig/whatsapp story and actual life stories)

Continuing to try to learn Indian female psychology through me.

He revealed sides of him I was completely unaware of...insinuating girls only befriend their exes because ‚Äòfemales like to have orbitors aka male friends who wanna FUCK THEM‚Äô So saying that he wants to still fuck me but not date me?

What a classy thing to say/assume...wow, _aaap toh keh rahe the aap bade ache gao se aye hain!_(family values/ideals et al)

The saddest part was when he exhibited that he still thinks I was not trying to befriend him because he said he doesn‚Äôt lead on women who are looking for a boyfriend...while he had already led me on multiple times(I have a pdf for my list)

But at the end of the day, the lesson I have learned is, I projected perfection on this person. And he proved me wrong. 

Which is nice...I learned a lot...both about myself and some confirmation about how desi male brain works...can‚Äôt even call it a confirmation _‚Äòbias‚Äô_ at this point...

He poked fun of how late I lost my virginity(as if it weren‚Äôt my choice to wait that long) and also of my choice to stay monogamous even during the talking stage(‚ÄúI USED to be like you‚Äù - he said)...as if I am some kind of unfinished project/living in oblivion about dating and sex and yet to discover the ‚Äòfun‚Äô  one night stands/hookup culture/short term dating can be...

I wish I could tell him that I knew what he was doing when he told me that he had a dream that his parents saw us at a concert and wanted to get us married

I wish I could tell him that I knew how wrong he was about me in so many aspects

I wish I could tell him the range of emotions I felt during my time being in contact with him...both good and bad

I wish I could see his face when I confronted him about his lies...

But honestly I am finally accepting its not worth it...

Because he will continue to think he is awesome and did nothing wrong...

There is simply nothing left to decode...

You can‚Äôt expect anything but hurt when you try to hug a cactus...

An unsure unfinished unhealed person...

A self proclaimed damaged person who is unwilling to fix his damage...

A liar, who thinks woman are stupid and can be lied to...

At least I am self-aware about my flaws and working on them...

Because I am _flaw-some_, and he is just self proclaimed _awesome_...

So last night I finally realized there is no point rereading and sending these screengrabs to multiple people trying to ‚Äòprove‚Äô how this person flipped the script on me multiple times due to his own confusion and issues...

There is simply no point left...

I am usually more poetic when it comes to things like this but publishing this rough draft with no edits whatsoever gives me more satisfaction than spending more of my creative energy on this person...

Hope you continue to get/seek white validation or whatever you are looking for...

Hope you find another girl to take with you on that _Vande Bhaarat_ flight(if that wasn‚Äôt a lie)...

I anyways have also started to think you may be too _fancy_ for me...

And I might be too _sweet_ for you...
