Spending another summer teaching for Girls Who Code was very rewarding. It was even better than GWC 2016 because I loved living in California. I stayed in Berkeley and commuted to SF for the job everyday.
I often hung out with some friends I knew from my undergrad who live there now. We explored all the delicious food Berkeley, Oakland, and SF had to offer. I would love to live in the Bay Area again.
