Today is womens's day! Isn't it so nice that we have off today? This led to me finally publishing 3(out of 10) poems that I wrote in 2020. The themes of these poems are very much so femme. I also answer the recurring question about AM I GAY. I have been teased on this SO MUCH. Snide comments about how I would LOVE Superbowl Halftime performance with Rihanna baaji(to quote my friend Kanza) or Beyonce Baaji or Shakira Baaji

Also themes of how I pick the wrong friends at times, But I feel I can't be blamed on _some_ level. Its like a _sprectrum_. When I hung out with desi girlies I got slut shamed and when I hung out with American girlies I got virgin-shamed. Hence I stay alone in my room and watch Netflix lol. But I finally feel I might be in the right continent. Will give a proper verdict soon in a different blog post.

For now enjoy these three poems...
