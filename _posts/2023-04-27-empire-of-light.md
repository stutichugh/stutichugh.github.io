Empire of light is a British-American movie directed by Sam Mendes.

I didn’t go into this movie knowing it was about mental illness and simply went because my friend Hanna invited me and I wanted to see her (she knows me well, I guess?)

Its a love story between a woman named Hilary who is suffering from bipolar disorder and an Afro-European man, set in an English coastal town in the early 1980s. Both of them work at a cinema and have multiple discriminatory instances. Some of it was hard to watch (A trigger warning would have been nice)

I think the most pivotal thing about the movie was how they both supported and understood each other because they were equally disenfranchised but for different reasons. One could see how comforting it was for Stephen(Afro-European) to have an explicitly racially charged incident to be relabeled from ‘just angry’ to ‘blatant racism’ by Hilary. And Hilary found belonging and comfort in Stephen’s company because he was able to relabel her manic incident from ‘crazy’ to just ‘intense’. Oh, how much of a difference positively/justifiably relabeling events/incidents can make!

Movies like these should be encouraged because they normalize mental illness and inter-racial relationships
