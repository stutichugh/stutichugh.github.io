One of my new year resolution has been to reduce my screen-time, or atleast get off instagram. I talked about how I did it by switching to Pinterest in one of my earlier blog. But I felt a reading goal would 
be even more helpful, as it would also help fix my attention span. I vowed to read books this year, and I think with the pace I am going at thus far, I may just achieve my goal in 2024. I already did a review of the Ali Abdaal book on productivity 
earlier this year. Following are the summaries/review of my favorite and most impactful spring reads thus far:

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6529826553">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Ego is the Enemy is a great read in the self-dev genre. If you self-identify as an egotistical person or have been given a subtle (or not-so-subtle) nudge to read this book by friends and/or family to work on this vice of yours, this book can feel like a difficult and uncomfortable read. Some chapters felt like an attack for me, which actually says a lot about how this book challenged my ideas, beliefs, and worldview, but in a good way, because we all know comfort and growth can't coexist.<br /><br />The book details anecdotes from great people of the world that Author Ryan encountered who ruined their own success, sometimes while being on the peak of their career by being 'drunk on ego'. He also compares egoism to be as harmful as alcoholism. <br /><br />Personally this book was very helpful, and if you're like me - a person whose ego gets bruised very easily, say, upon receiving a harsh feedback or a romantic rejection- making these learning opportunities and minor inconveniences into a massive sore; this book can be of great help. I'd suggest though to alternate and pair each chapter with a lighter read like a fun fiction novel or an episode of a TV show as some chapters can really feel like a harsh attack.<br /><br />I don't know if this defeats the purpose of this book but I was comforted by the fact that the closing chapter congratulates the reader for coming this far and acknowledges it to be a difficult read by saying - <b>"Its not easy task to go head-to-head with one’s ego. To accept first that ego maybe there. Then to subject it to scrutiny and criticism" </b><br /><br />Following were some standout quotes/anecdotes for me: <br /><br /><blockquote><br />Think less of yourself, be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world changing work you’ve set out to achieve<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />There is a petulant child inside every person, the one that chooses to get his or her way over anything or anyone<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Ego soothes fear, its a salve to insecurity<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Detachment is sort of natural ego antidote<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />A man’s best treasure is a thrifty tongue<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />>=< : We all need to have someone better we can learn from, someone lesser who we can teach, someone equal we can challenge ourselves against<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Great passions are maladies without hope<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries, Realism is detachment and perspective<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Greatness comes from humble beginnings, it comes from grunt work<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /><b>JACKIE ROBINSON anecdote(most impactful story for me)</b>:<br /> - His path called for him to put aside both his ego and In some respects his basic sense of fairness and rights as a human being<br /> - Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure in the ring<br /></blockquote><br /> <blockquote><br />“You’re not special” theory reminding me of <i>Mark Manson- Subtle Art</i> book<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />It requires strong constitution to withstand repeated attacks of prosperity<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Ego loves this notion - the idea whether something is “fair” or not<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even perfectly. Yet, the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />If your reputation can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /> Greats hold themselves up to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Looking at life challenges and ordeals with an eye of an <b>Indifferent spectator </b><br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /> A person who can think long term doesn’t pity herself during short term setbacks<br /></blockquote>

<p>Radical Acceptance is a great book that appeared on my Pinterest feed one day as being a great read -"if you're on your healing journey as it is the most transformational book you'd read. So much wisdom on how to move through deep rooted self-doubt and insecurities + how can we heal fear and shame". I think the book delivered, based on what this pinner described it to be. The book has detailed accounts and examples from clients of the author -who is a psychotherapist who also practices Buddhism, yoga, and goes on many retreats- that can help one with their own personal challenges. She also shares stories from her own personal life, lending different perspectives on how to look at life challenges and stand strong through them whilst also extracting wisdom out of our wounds. </p><br /><p>There are also some very helpful personal accounts of her guiding high achievers through their failures, that I really related with. I paired this read with a roadtrip I myself took to a very meditative Buddhist location, which made it such a fitting read. <br /><br />For me this book helped with learning <u>forgiveness, mindfulness, embracing the mystery of life, and overcoming challenges that come with having an addictive personality.</u><br /></p><br />Couple things I didn't like about this read was <b> a)</b> not having trigger warnings prior to launching into very personal traumatic stories from her client's life because as much as those stories were helpful in providing perspective, they were also disturbing to read. <b>b)</b> there are many guided meditations and journaling exercises within the book which I appreciate, but how is the reader supposed to follow them? It was confusing to me as some of them begun with -"so now close your eyes...", I guess for that to work, the reader would need an audio book version. <br /><br />Other than that a great read<br /><br />Following were some gems that stood out for me:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />- Beneath all my mood swings, depression, loneliness, addictive behavior lurked that feeling of deep personal deficiency<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Awakening from trance of unworthiness : the way out of our cage begins with accepting absolutely everything about ourselves and our lives<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We amplify emotional pain with our judgements and stories<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Instead of resisting our feelings of fear and grief, we embrace our pain with the kindness of a mother holding her child<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Compassion honors our experience; it allows us to be intimate with life of this moment as it is<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am then I can change<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- When a harsh self judgement appeared I could recognize it simply as a passing thought<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Suffering is an intrinsic part of being alive<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- This artifice of neither grasping nor pushing away any experience is known as the Middle Way in Buddhism<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- A place where she could be aware of her pain without feeling possessed or overwhelmed by it<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Usually underneath a person's fiery exterior is a wounded person<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Sit with the pain and discomfort instead of resorting to addictions , tv, venting to friends<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We practice Radical Acceptance by pausing and then meeting whatever is happening inside us with this kind of unconditional friendliness<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Bow to the experience<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- “Inviting <i>Mara</i> to tea”: say yes to pain in leg, blaming thoughts, sneezes, irritation, gloomy gray sky<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Saying yes doesn’t mean acting on our harmful impulses and approving of angry thoughts <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The truth about our childhood is stored in our body<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- In both Buddhist psychologists and western experiential therapy this process of experiencing and accepting the changing stream of sensations is central to the alchemy of transformation <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Emotions is a combination of physical sensation and the stories we tell ourselves <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Layers of historic hurt, fear, or anger may begin to play themselves out in the light of awareness <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The cure for pain is in the pain- Rumi<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We often think freedom from desire would take the fun out of life. When he(Buddha) said craving causes suffering he was referring not our natural inclination as living being to have wants and needs but to our habit of clinging to experience that must, by nature, pass away<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Vipassana romance - the mind can build a whole erotic world around a person we barely know <i>(limerance vibes)</i><br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- When we can’t meet our emotional needs directly, the wanting self develops strategies for satisfying them with substitutes <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /><i>(very helpful strategy for binge eaters, smokers, alcoholics)</i><br />- <u>Assisted pause</u>: calling a friend /sponsor/ buddy during a food binge urge instead of heading to the fridge: OA group personal stories <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The Buddha taught that by being aware of desire we free ourselves from identifying with it<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- What perpetuates fear is the horrible pain of isolation<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We need to be reminded that we are part of something larger than our own frightened self.<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The Buddhist practice of “taking refuge” awakens and cultivates that inner experience of safety and belonging<br /><br />- In Buddhism, the three fundamental refuges are:<br /> - The Buddha(awakened nature)<br /> - The Dharma(the pathos the way)<br /> - The Sangha( the community of spiritual aspirants)<br /></blockquote><br /><br />- “When I am feeling fear, I surrender it to the Beloved”<br /><blockquote><br /> <u>Meditation and medication section</u>:<br /> - “Don’t medications numb the very experiences we are now trying to unconditionally accept?”<br /> - “Its hard to imagine Buddha reaching for prozac while under the Bodhi Tree”<br /> - “But when fear is too overwhelming, medical intervention, at least for a period of time, maybe the most compassionate response. Like insulin for a diabetic, medications shift an imbalanced chemistry towards normalcy”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- thoughts are just thoughts, not the truth about how things were<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Simply name whatever experience arises, say a friendly hello and invite it to sit beside you<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Fear is an intrinsic part of being alive, resisting it means resisting life<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The key to awakening from the bonds of fear is to move from our mental stories into immediate contact with the sensations of fear<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- In Buddhist tradition, one who has realized the fullness of compassion and lives from compassion is called a Bodhisattva<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- At times like these, the only way to find compassion for ourselves is by reaching out to something larger than the self that feels so small and miserable <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- “True love and prayer are learned in the hours where prayer has become impossible and the heart has turned to stone”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Feeling compassion for ourselves in no way releases us from responsibility for our actions. Rather, it releases us from the self-hatred that prevents us from responding to our life with clarity and balance”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Someone using “to whom it may concern” if/when not sure who to address the prayer to- (can be useful way for agnostics)<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- <b>“If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man’s life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm hostility” </b><br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The word “resentment” means “to feel again”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Often enough our resentment of others reflects our resentment of ourselves<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The Buddhist perspective holds that there is no such thing as a sinful or evil person. When we harm ourselves or others, it is not because we are bad but because we are ignorant<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- “We can’t punish ourselves into being a good person”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- If we feel hatred toward anyone, we remain chained to the sufferings of past and cannot find genuine peace. We forgive for the freedom of our own heart.<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- When we forgive, we stop rigidly identifying others by their undesirable behavior<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- “...fall into the habit of pinning a narrow and static identity on those around us. All too often this is based on behaviors we find unpleasant and annoying"<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Our collection of assumptions doesn’t define a person <br /></blockquote>

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6511372901">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Verity is ofcourse a Colleen Hoover classic recommended to anyone trying to find a steamy thriller to read. The book doesn't feel like as much of a page turner as advertised until page 60ish which is when it turns into <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ a book within a book--(pay attention to chapter numbers and font going forward)  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>. After that it really picks up speed and I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I took 1 star away because I didn't like the ending. It was confusing and unconvincing which in itself sort of reveals which side of the <i> hashtag CoHort </i> debate I am on for this one. <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ I am Team Manuscript  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>. Given that books like <i> Gone Girl </i> and <i> Simple Favor </i> got me into the genre, some of the twists were expected which made me anticipate a very different ending. In my head a better ending would have been if <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ Jeremy did all of this to get Verity's life insurance money (like in Simple Favor) and tweaked the manuscript to incriminate her, so that he could run away with a new woman Lowen who is less successful as he grew envious of his wife's success  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book that stood out to me: <br /><br /><blockquote><br />“He’s handsome, but there is something about him that makes me think he wishes he weren’t. Almost as if his looks might be an inconvenience to him. A part of him he doesn’t want anyone to notice, He wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me”<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><br />You seek people like you…people worse off than you…and you use them to make yourself feel better about the terrible things that have happened to you<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />...lipstick so red, its a little jarring at nine thirty in the morning<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Such an ass. He’s good in bed, like most assholes<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />The richer you are, the more creative you’re able to be<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />An autobiography encouraging the reader to like the author is not a true autobiography. No one is likable from the inside out<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />I was not the mouse, I was the cheese<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Desire and respect- two things a lot of men didn’t seem to know could go hand in hand<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />But a woman knows if she wants to keep a man forever, she has to act like she could get over him in a day<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Caring for an egg shell with no yolk<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Perceived his patience as weakness<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />
