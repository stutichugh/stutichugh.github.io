Mentors who mentor...and mentors who don't

Mentoring/Buddy is an important part of your onboardin

I mentored soumyadeep, Sanyam mentored me.

Here’s how good mentors mentor

### Examples of good mentors:

* They show interest in YOU(not the _Penn Badgley_ show), I mean like - all of you, the analyst AND the person you
* They don’t mind texting at odd hours. (This can be kind of controversial, but honestly with the geospatial analysis (with _Sanyam_),I didn’t mind an occasional brainstorm sesh on a Saturday)
* They help you learn the ins and outs of the company but also show interest in ways they can learn from you
* They make onboarding easy
* They take time to explain you things and help you get unstuck (without saying passive aggressive things like -google it, why are you wasting the senior analysts’ time, et al)
* They bring you Swiss chocolate to welcome you to the office
* Have a word or two about _Hasan Minhaj_ (because they are his name-twin)

And now a section about Mentors who don’t(mentor well):

DISCLAIMER: you can stop reading at this point if you are one of those _hashtag good vibes only_ type neurotypical person

DISCLAIMER 2: None of these are exaggerations/‘just for material’. All are inspired by true events and some of these are direct quotes.

* Good mentors don't send you a bunch of _flower emoji_, and tell you that your lipstick is _fire emoji_, and then trash you at their farewell party(after hugging you a bunch)
* Good mentors don't get irritated when asked too many query questions (but not at all irritated whilst explaining excel and other things for an extended period of time to a non-tech/data hire(who conveniently uses precious work hours to ‘pick people’s' brain) and ends up turning said ‘brain picking’ into a 5 hour unpaid therapy session)
* Excessively empathize with a non-tech/data hire about how their salary is equivalent to that a of five guys employee, considering their currency exchange compared to US, whilst conveniently ignoring how currency(India)<<<<<<<currency(America)
* Good mentors don't recurrently cancel or reschedule each _mentor weekly_ meeting by using the following texts/excuses:
    - “hey we have a check-in in 3 mins but I don’t think I have anything to discuss or talk about - do you?”
    - “look, you can either leave the company or talk to your supervisor to create a new role for yourself”
    - “Hey your mom is here, I think we can cancel this 1-1 so you can spend time with her”

Ok I’ll stop here because a) the blog is getting too long b) I have been getting a lot “I’m concerned about you DMs” and *support/care emojis*
