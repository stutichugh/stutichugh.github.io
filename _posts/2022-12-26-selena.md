I just got an Apple TV trial to watch _My Mind & Me_ by Selena Gomez. My main motivation was that her and I share the same mental health diagnosis and it was recommended by my friends and family. As much as I appreciate people caring about me and wanting me to relate, I did not like the documentary a whole lot. I made some notes while watching it and my icloud notes didn't sync so it all got deleted, yet I am chosing to write this review from memory because I am compelled to. But I am not invested enough to rewatch the doc to have better/new notes, if that tells you something.

The documentary shows how Selena stuggled with depression and anxiety during revival tour and post her breakup with Justin Bieber. The paparrazi and media won't leave her alone. Its a shame how celebrities have no privacy. She was rumored to have a drug problem. She started working at the age or 11( or 7, i dont remember) and that took a toll on her mental health as well. Being in the limelight as such a young age can be challenging. (we all know what happened to Lindsey Lohan)

Thankfully she had great friends and a good suppory system in the form of her mom and step dad. She could want thai at 7AM in the morning and her entourage would just "make it happen" for her which is nice.

Its ironic that I found it long and boring despite that we share the SAME DIAGNOSIS! I was checking when it ends every few minutes, not because it was painful, but because I was bored. I am thinking that's how my friends and family feel about me as well when I talk about my struggles.

Its hard to befriend a chronic illness warrior. I understand that now.

All in all, I am glad she got help and the best thing she said was - "I have learned to make bipolar _my friend_".

Here are some tweets I could relate to:
