Happy Valentine's day...I guess lol.

Not but for real...happy valentine's day. My 2 favorite valentines day movies are of the same theme by two doppleganger actresses.

_Natalie Portman_ and _Mila Kunis_ ....queens

I Like _No Strings Attached_ a little more than _Friends with Benefits_...not sure Why

I think because former also has _Mindy Kaling_ and _Greta Gerwig_ and Nick!(from New Girl lol)

Both movies have same moral: No strings attached doesn't work. Hahahah

Other than that, I deleted hinge. and bumble(even bff)

I am doing good I think

LASTLY, and neurotypicals can look away if they want...

* yaar, I’m not racist but don’t you think there are TOO MANY Turkish people in Germany
* I think neurodivergent are more SPECIAL than neurotypicals
* Yaar, I don’t like Netflix Comedy, it’s very much like…’Vir Das’-for the lack of a better word
* I wouldn’t personally hire someone who asks for extension{on an interview assignment}
* [8:30PM] my workday is not over yet
* My boss scoffed at me for working too
* Yaar, you’re very TRADITIONAL, you should make that clear on your apps that you would serious and such n such and that things you said about not wanting to sleep around Willy nilly
* Honestly you shouldn’t be psyched about meeting me, I am a guy who just got distracted by a ladybird while catching the ubahn
* Yaar, I wanted to come to Berlin to welcome you, but then again, you’re like TOO TRADITIONAL, so I changed my mind
* Damn girl, let’s hope you get that offer soon so this mess can end
* Wow finally after being after you since I was 16, I managed to get your number
* {before an interview} me: time to cosplay as a ‘fun n cute girl who is not neurodivergent’, him: you ARE fun and cute
* This whole thing with HF is just a glitch
* Me: when you say you were the topper, I feel I peaked in high school. Him: there is no such thing as peaking
* I have never met anyone at my level intellectually {went to Punjab engineering college, not MIT}

Ok I’ll stop here because a) the blog is getting too long b) I have been getting a lot “I’m concerned about you DMs” and *support/care emojis*
