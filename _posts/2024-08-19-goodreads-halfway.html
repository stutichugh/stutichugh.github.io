Reading is such a joyful and meditative activity, but it also reminded me how real the concept of inertia from physics classes is—a body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion stays in motion. My reading inertia was broken when I visited a book fair—or rather, a book buffet, if you will—where I could fill a box with as many books as I wanted (I got 20). That experience reignited my reading journey.

Aside from the book fair, my desire to <b>reduce screen time</b> and <b>improve my attention span</b> has been crucial in staying on track with my reading. I often find myself pairing work breaks with Instagram scrolling. While this can be amusing, it’s also detrimental, as Instagram tends to reflect our exact life circumstances. To avoid getting triggered and ruminating over something that just happened, I’ve switched to <a href="/assets/images/2024-03-01-pinterest.md"> Pinterest</a> for my scrolling breaks. Additionally, I’m making an effort to steer clear of the <i> compare and despair </i> trap that social media often fosters.

What also helps is having the Goodreads app on my phone, as it constantly reminds me when I’m falling behind. Seeing notifications like the one in the screenshot below triggers my inner achiever, motivating me to stay on track.

That’s why I was thrilled to receive a positive update from the app last night telling me that I am finally caught up!

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6716766870">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
tl;dr <b> This is an excellent crime novel. 4.5 stars </b>
<br /><br /><br />Before I give a review I wanted to share an anecdote from a time I wasn’t as much of a reader.<br /><br /><i> I once asked my English major friend during our undergrad days to suggest me a book to develop reading as a habit, to which he said- “Stuti, you don’t find a good book, a good book finds you”. I laughed at the time, but I feel that is what happened with me when I picked this up at a book fair. </i><br /><br />I went into this with no prior knowledge of the author, or its Goodreads rating, or the fact that its a famous series, or anything at all. I was just aware that I enjoy the thriller genre, psychological thrillers to be precise. If anything this was more so in the ‘crime’ section. Nonetheless I grabbed it along with 19 other books at that book buffet.<br /><br /><i>The Cutting Place</i> opens with a crime scene wherein a journalist - Paige -has been murdered in a grotesque way and thrown into the River Thames (yes, set in London). Investigators are just beginning to pick up the pieces (figuratively and literally) of Paige’s life (and body) - trying to unravel who killed Paige and what could be their motive. <br /><br />This leads them into the discovery of Chiron (pronounced Ky-ron) Club, an exclusive males only club that was home to illicit use of drugs and sex with women initially hired as waitresses(or for their gaze). Paige had been trying to write a story uncovering this club, which makes its members the prime suspect for Paige’s death. A lot gets revealed as they go down the Chiron rabbit hole. Stories that may or may not add to the investigation, but nonetheless intriguing and gut wrenching.<br /><br />Despite the grotesque nature of vivid descriptions of what these men did at this club, I was compelled to read this book all the way till the end because within the first 50 pages, I had developed a personal connection with Paige’s character. And the fact that her killer wasn’t revealed up until the very last chapter, led me to continue reading this crime fiction, which I could have otherwise abandoned due to its triggering nature in some aspects. <br /><br /><blockquote> <b> She wanted to be a proper investigative journalist, digging into the dark side of life, uncovering the truth. But no one took her seriously. She couldn’t persuade anyone to give her a job in that area. They wanted her to write color stuff, fashion, and celebrity news. It drove her mad. She really knew what she was doing - all she needed was someone to give her a break. But she was determined and I felt she was going to succeed one way or another. She went freelance so she could work on the stories she wanted to tell” </b> </blockquote> (pg 43)<br /><br />I have never felt more seen, especially didn’t expect to feel this way via a fiction crime novel journalist character. I feel a lot of women don’t get their due in serious career paths, especially if they have a knack for fashion(and/or humor).

There is a high likelihood I may have made similar comments to my stem-tech female colleagues on days they wore a cute outfit to office. To that end I just wanted to leave this here:

When they found Paige’s body, one way to distinguish her from others was the fact that her body had manicured nails so they specifically looked for missing persons report within that demographic: someone who looks like a person who had the kind of job that paid well enough (and left enough room in the schedule) to get waxed and manicured on a biweekly basis. It is my biggest pet peeves when someone tries to box me into a stereotype in my own professional setting, due to my appearance, which is why I went into the rest of the novel, ready to relate to/empathize with Paige, but came out the other end appreciating so much more about this book. <br /><br />I wouldn’t reveal the killer, the motive, or how much of it had to do with her doing a story on this literal boys club, because I would compel everyone to read this book and find on their own.<br /><br />I am giving half a star less because (and this is the only spoiler I will give) <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler on goodreads)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ I felt the whole story arc wherein Sergeant Kerrigan’s boyfriend turned out to be abusive was weird and unrealistic. There were no signs for him to turn out to suddenly abuse her like that and it felt like that kind of came out a left field, unless I missed something. Also I don’t know how that added to the plot about Chiron Club or Paige’s story and felt like an abrupt digression to me.  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />Other than this, great read, highly recommended.<br /><br />Following are some other quotes that stood out to me:<br /><br /><blockquote> [a member of Chiron club explained why club is exlcusive men only] Its never arisen, one of the issues, you see, is that we are not altogether keen on the feminist movement, which seems designed to reward the less able simply by virtue of their sex </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>[investigator reflecting on their chiron club notes thus far] My interview with Sir Marcus Gley gave me the impression it was nothing more than a collection of over-privileged men making opportunities for one another, which wasn't exactly a scandal </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> <b> Even nice guys will do horrible things if they think no one’s going to find out </b></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> They use young women as toys and consume illegal drugs </blockquote><br /><br /> <blockquote>I don’t know if you’ve a quota to hit or something but it wasn’t a murder </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> [another quote about Paige] <b> She wasn’t the police. She was really full of herself and everything she was going to achieve but she wasn’t all that bright. She’d get obsessed with something she was writing about and bore on about it, like everyone else should care too. Totally self absorbed” </b></blockquote><br /><br /> <blockquote> [yet another quote about Paige] <b>She was a little self obsessed. Life taught her to be selfish, to be her own hero. She wasn’t remotely interested in talking about what you wanted to talk about</b> </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> [one last quote about Paige (did i mention already that I liked her character!)] <b>She was single minded to a fault. She was the cat that walked by herself- and as a result she’d taught herself that she didn't need anyone. When you spoke to her she was drunk enough to be chatty, but she only wanted to talk about her work, her exciting project that was occupying all of her time and energy. </b> </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>He looked like what he pretended to be, a handsome confident solicitor, and he did not look at all like a man who could coldly and deliberately beat me unconscious, even though that was exactly what he was. </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> <b> I promise you, I done want anything like revenge. I just want justice </b> </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>But they were invisible evil. They hid in plain sight, behind handsome faces and the swagger of wealth</blockquote>
