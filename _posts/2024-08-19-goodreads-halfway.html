Reading is such a joyful and meditative activity, but it also reminded me how real the concept of inertia from physics classes is—a body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion stays in motion. My reading inertia was broken when I visited a book fair—or rather, a book buffet, if you will—where I could fill a box with as many books as I wanted (I got 20). That experience reignited my reading journey.

<p>
Aside from the book fair, my desire to <b>reduce screen time</b> and <b>improve my attention span</b> has been crucial in staying on track with my reading. I often find myself pairing work breaks with Instagram scrolling. While this can be amusing, it’s also detrimental, as Instagram tends to reflect our exact life circumstances. To avoid getting triggered and ruminating over something that just happened, I’ve switched to <a href="https://stutichugh.github.io/pinterest.md"> Pinterest</a> for my scrolling breaks. 
Additionally, I’m making an effort to steer clear of the <i> compare and despair </i> trap that social media often fosters.
</p>

<p>
What also helps is having the Goodreads app on my phone, as it constantly reminds me when I’m falling behind. Seeing notifications like the one in the screenshot below triggers my inner achiever, motivating me to stay on track.

That’s why I was thrilled to receive a positive update from the app last night telling me that I am finally caught up!

tl;dr <b> This is an excellent crime novel. 4.5 stars </b>
<br /><br /><br />Before I give a review I wanted to share an anecdote from a time I wasn’t as much of a reader.<br /><br /><i> I once asked my English major friend during our undergrad days to suggest me a book to develop reading as a habit, to which he said- “Stuti, you don’t find a good book, a good book finds you”. I laughed at the time, but I feel that is what happened with me when I picked this up at a book fair. </i><br /><br />I went into this with no prior knowledge of the author, or its Goodreads rating, or the fact that its a famous series, or anything at all. I was just aware that I enjoy the thriller genre, psychological thrillers to be precise. If anything this was more so in the ‘crime’ section. Nonetheless I grabbed it along with 19 other books at that book buffet.<br /><br /><i>The Cutting Place</i> opens with a crime scene wherein a journalist - Paige -has been murdered in a grotesque way and thrown into the River Thames (yes, set in London). Investigators are just beginning to pick up the pieces (figuratively and literally) of Paige’s life (and body) - trying to unravel who killed Paige and what could be their motive. <br /><br />This leads them into the discovery of Chiron (pronounced Ky-ron) Club, an exclusive males only club that was home to illicit use of drugs and sex with women initially hired as waitresses(or for their gaze). Paige had been trying to write a story uncovering this club, which makes its members the prime suspect for Paige’s death. A lot gets revealed as they go down the Chiron rabbit hole. Stories that may or may not add to the investigation, but nonetheless intriguing and gut wrenching.<br /><br />Despite the grotesque nature of vivid descriptions of what these men did at this club, I was compelled to read this book all the way till the end because within the first 50 pages, I had developed a personal connection with Paige’s character. And the fact that her killer wasn’t revealed up until the very last chapter, led me to continue reading this crime fiction, which I could have otherwise abandoned due to its triggering nature in some aspects. <br /><br /><blockquote> <b> She wanted to be a proper investigative journalist, digging into the dark side of life, uncovering the truth. But no one took her seriously. She couldn’t persuade anyone to give her a job in that area. They wanted her to write color stuff, fashion, and celebrity news. It drove her mad. She really knew what she was doing - all she needed was someone to give her a break. But she was determined and I felt she was going to succeed one way or another. She went freelance so she could work on the stories she wanted to tell” </b> </blockquote> (pg 43)<br /><br />I have never felt more seen, especially didn’t expect to feel this way via a fiction crime novel journalist character. I feel a lot of women don’t get their due in serious career paths, especially if they have a knack for fashion(and/or humor).

There is a high likelihood I may have made similar comments to my stem-tech female colleagues on days they wore a cute outfit to office. To that end I just wanted to leave this here:

<br/>
When they found Paige’s body, one way to distinguish her from others was the fact that her body had manicured nails so they specifically looked for missing persons report within that demographic: someone who looks like a person who had the kind of job that paid well enough (and left enough room in the schedule) to get waxed and manicured on a biweekly basis. It is my biggest pet peeves when someone tries to box me into a stereotype in my own professional setting, due to my appearance, which is why I went into the rest of the novel, ready to relate to/empathize with Paige, but came out the other end appreciating so much more about this book. <br /><br />I wouldn’t reveal the killer, the motive, or how much of it had to do with her doing a story on this literal boys club, because I would compel everyone to read this book and find on their own.<br /><br />I am giving half a star less because (and this is the only spoiler I will give) <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler on goodreads)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ I felt the whole story arc wherein Sergeant Kerrigan’s boyfriend turned out to be abusive was weird and unrealistic. There were no signs for him to turn out to suddenly abuse her like that and it felt like that kind of came out a left field, unless I missed something. Also I don’t know how that added to the plot about Chiron Club or Paige’s story and felt like an abrupt digression to me.  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />Other than this, great read, highly recommended.<br /><br />Following are some other quotes that stood out to me:<br /><br /><blockquote> [a member of Chiron club explained why club is exlcusive men only] Its never arisen, one of the issues, you see, is that we are not altogether keen on the feminist movement, which seems designed to reward the less able simply by virtue of their sex </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>[investigator reflecting on their chiron club notes thus far] My interview with Sir Marcus Gley gave me the impression it was nothing more than a collection of over-privileged men making opportunities for one another, which wasn't exactly a scandal </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> <b> Even nice guys will do horrible things if they think no one’s going to find out </b></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> They use young women as toys and consume illegal drugs </blockquote><br /><br /> <blockquote>I don’t know if you’ve a quota to hit or something but it wasn’t a murder </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> [another quote about Paige] <b> She wasn’t the police. She was really full of herself and everything she was going to achieve but she wasn’t all that bright. She’d get obsessed with something she was writing about and bore on about it, like everyone else should care too. Totally self absorbed” </b></blockquote><br /><br /> <blockquote> [yet another quote about Paige] <b>She was a little self obsessed. Life taught her to be selfish, to be her own hero. She wasn’t remotely interested in talking about what you wanted to talk about</b> </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> [one last quote about Paige (did i mention already that I liked her character!)] <b>She was single minded to a fault. She was the cat that walked by herself- and as a result she’d taught herself that she didn't need anyone. When you spoke to her she was drunk enough to be chatty, but she only wanted to talk about her work, her exciting project that was occupying all of her time and energy. </b> </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>He looked like what he pretended to be, a handsome confident solicitor, and he did not look at all like a man who could coldly and deliberately beat me unconscious, even though that was exactly what he was. </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote> <b> I promise you, I done want anything like revenge. I just want justice </b> </blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>But they were invisible evil. They hid in plain sight, behind handsome faces and the swagger of wealth</blockquote>

  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6700989398">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  I have had a love-hate type of feels towards Priyanka over the years but there is no denying the fact that she is one of the biggest awe-worthy artists/celebrity of Indian descent and since I have very little exposure to career-oriented role models in my personal life I decided to pick up this book. Its a very easy read, first of, easy to understand, not more than 250 pages, so it paired perfectly with my recent road trip.<br /><br />The way Priyanka detailed her experiences, right from childhood, accompanying her Doctor/Army parents to summer field trips to impoverished parts of India where girl child is thrown away(literally), to how she is now the brand ambassador of UNICEF, and sharing about her philanthropy that sponsors girls’ education, left me in awe.<br /><br />I also felt the saying “it takes a village” — came to my mind as she shared how her parents and extended family took turns taking responsibility of her or her brother, while this Army family with conventionally successful careers of Doctors and Engineers were trying to adjust the new reality of their daughter entering the entertainment industry post her surprise win of the Miss World 2000 pageant. <br /><br />I am no Priyanka Chopra of course, but I will say, reading about this sudden shift at the age of 17, the problems that arose with it, the sudden pivot life took upon achieving this title, having to do interviews to represent more than yourself( but also the country in her case, city/school in mine), reminded me of my own ‘mini-pageant’ that I won at the age of 16, that changed the course of my life and destiny. Mine was more of an regional/state level academic nature. <a> this (if you're curious) https://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080530/jal.htm </a><br /><br />Reading about how the way people viewed her changed in a single night, her mention of her family being subject to “harsh scrutiny, cruel/petty gossip, etc” that comes from emerging a mini celebrity out of your small hometown(Bareilly in her case, Amritsar in mine), just the whole aftermath revealing people’s true colors (or how my parents generation would summarize it to be: post big win leading to jealousy infused nazar -”bad energy/vibes”)- was very relatable. <br /><br /><b> “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown”</b> - William Shakespeare, Henry IV, part 2 <— this is the (very apt) quote that was at the beginning of her Miss World win chapter <br /><br />Other than that, another relatable thing about her book for me was the scrutiny around her accent/ complexion. There is no denying the fact that when you are Indian but have an accent and/or complexion that mimics the west (light skin and /or American accent), you are inadvertently more susceptible to unexplained hate/catty behavior, especially from the same sex. There is no humble way for me to put it, but I have lived it, it is what it is. <br /><br />Other than these two pieces, something I am leaps and bounds behind being able to relate to Priyanka, is her impeccable work ethic. I was super impressed by her detailing those 7-8 weeks of her life where she was shooting for both <i>Quantico</i> and <i>Bajiro Mastani</i>, and was flying into India for the weekend and back to Montreal/NYC for Quantico. Effort like that really requires some next level commitment.<br /><br />I strongly believe her being from Army background as well as going to boarding school and high school in US at such an early age prepared her for the great life she went on to live.<br /><br />She also goes on to share her self-destructive dating patterns, how she overcome them and met Nick. By the time one reaches the Nick/<i>Shaadi</i> chapter of this book(and her life), the reader is so in awe of all the challenges our <i>desi</i> girl has endured, (including the painful grief from death of her Dad), that you just smile ear to ear, saying “ah she deserves it” as you read about her love story. At least I did<br /><br />If you’re looking for a quick heart-warming and inspiring read of a star who embarked an unchartered territory starting at the young age of 17 to navigating her mixed identity by making it into Hollywood and going global with her work, this is a perfect memoir to get your hands on.<br /><br />

  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6529826553">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  Ego is the Enemy is a great read in the self-dev genre. If you self-identify as an egotistical person or have been given a subtle (or not-so-subtle) nudge to read this book by friends and/or family to work on this vice of yours, this book can feel like a difficult and uncomfortable read. Some chapters felt like an attack for me, which actually says a lot about how this book challenged my ideas, beliefs, and worldview, but in a good way, because we all know comfort and growth can't coexist.<br /><br />The book details anecdotes from great people of the world that Author Ryan encountered who ruined their own success, sometimes while being on the peak of their career by being 'drunk on ego'. He also compares egoism to be as harmful as alcoholism. <br /><br />Personally this book was very helpful, and if you're like me - a person whose ego gets bruised very easily, say, upon receiving a harsh feedback or a romantic rejection- making these learning opportunities and minor inconveniences into a massive sore; this book can be of great help. I'd suggest though to alternate and pair each chapter with a lighter read like a fun fiction novel or an episode of a TV show as some chapters can really feel like a harsh attack.<br /><br />I don't know if this defeats the purpose of this book but I was comforted by the fact that the closing chapter congratulates the reader for coming this far and acknowledges it to be a difficult read by saying - <b>"Its not easy task to go head-to-head with one’s ego. To accept first that ego maybe there. Then to subject it to scrutiny and criticism" </b><br /><br />Following were some standout quotes/anecdotes for me: <br /><br /><blockquote><br />Think less of yourself, be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world changing work you’ve set out to achieve<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />There is a petulant child inside every person, the one that chooses to get his or her way over anything or anyone<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Ego soothes fear, its a salve to insecurity<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Detachment is sort of natural ego antidote<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />A man’s best treasure is a thrifty tongue<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />>=< : We all need to have someone better we can learn from, someone lesser who we can teach, someone equal we can challenge ourselves against<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Great passions are maladies without hope<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries, Realism is detachment and perspective<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Greatness comes from humble beginnings, it comes from grunt work<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /><b>JACKIE ROBINSON anecdote(most impactful story for me)</b>:<br /> - His path called for him to put aside both his ego and In some respects his basic sense of fairness and rights as a human being<br /> - Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure in the ring<br /></blockquote><br /> <blockquote><br />“You’re not special” theory reminding me of <i>Mark Manson- Subtle Art</i> book<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />It requires strong constitution to withstand repeated attacks of prosperity<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Ego loves this notion - the idea whether something is “fair” or not<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even perfectly. Yet, the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />If your reputation can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /> Greats hold themselves up to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Looking at life challenges and ordeals with an eye of an <b>Indifferent spectator </b><br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br /> A person who can think long term doesn’t pity herself during short term setbacks<br /></blockquote>

  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6719599043">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  This is a good book for anyone who self identifies as an introvert, regardless of whether or not they are in sales. <br /><br />In a world where we need to ‘sell ourselves’ in most areas of life, introverts can often get outlooked or misunderstood.<br /><br />The emotions associated with being misunderstood—like fury and rage, as I’ve experienced—can run high and sometimes ruin everything. That’s why my favorite chapter (and quote) from this book is <b>Win the fight, but lose the sale </b>. It echoes a question that’s been posed to me in the past: "Would you rather be happy or be right?" My answer used to be "both," but now I know better, of course.<br /><br />Another very common expression is the whole idea of ~<b>sell the sizzle, not the steak </b>~, which is well expanded in a chapter in this book.<br /><br />Other than that, this book also made me feel like I may actually not be an introvert after all. Because, well, for one, they say its someone who naturally doesn’t possess the ‘gift of gab’, which I think I do (ask my friends, family, employer, anyone). Secondly, some ‘techniques’ referred to in this book seem very common knowledge to me that I already inadvertently have used in interviews and other conversations.<br /><br />I strongly believe this whole introvert/extrovert thing is a spectrum, and not as black and white as the book assumes.<br /><br />I also learned from this book that I have been saying this one word wrong — its not schpeel , its <i>spiel</i> lol

  <p>Radical Acceptance is a great book that appeared on my Pinterest feed one day as being a great read -"if you're on your healing journey as it is the most transformational book you'd read. So much wisdom on how to move through deep rooted self-doubt and insecurities + how can we heal fear and shame". I think the book delivered, based on what this pinner described it to be. The book has detailed accounts and examples from clients of the author -who is a psychotherapist who also practices Buddhism, yoga, and goes on many retreats- that can help one with their own personal challenges. She also shares stories from her own personal life, lending different perspectives on how to look at life challenges and stand strong through them whilst also extracting wisdom out of our wounds. </p><br /><p>There are also some very helpful personal accounts of her guiding high achievers through their failures, that I really related with. I paired this read with a roadtrip I myself took to a very meditative Buddhist location, which made it such a fitting read. <br /><br />For me this book helped with learning <u>forgiveness, mindfulness, embracing the mystery of life, and overcoming challenges that come with having an addictive personality.</u><br /></p><br />Couple things I didn't like about this read was <b> a)</b> not having trigger warnings prior to launching into very personal traumatic stories from her client's life because as much as those stories were helpful in providing perspective, they were also disturbing to read. <b>b)</b> there are many guided meditations and journaling exercises within the book which I appreciate, but how is the reader supposed to follow them? It was confusing to me as some of them begun with -"so now close your eyes...", I guess for that to work, the reader would need an audio book version. <br /><br />Other than that a great read<br /><br />Following were some gems that stood out for me:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />- Beneath all my mood swings, depression, loneliness, addictive behavior lurked that feeling of deep personal deficiency<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Awakening from trance of unworthiness : the way out of our cage begins with accepting absolutely everything about ourselves and our lives<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We amplify emotional pain with our judgements and stories<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Instead of resisting our feelings of fear and grief, we embrace our pain with the kindness of a mother holding her child<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Compassion honors our experience; it allows us to be intimate with life of this moment as it is<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am then I can change<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- When a harsh self judgement appeared I could recognize it simply as a passing thought<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Suffering is an intrinsic part of being alive<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- This artifice of neither grasping nor pushing away any experience is known as the Middle Way in Buddhism<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- A place where she could be aware of her pain without feeling possessed or overwhelmed by it<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Usually underneath a person's fiery exterior is a wounded person<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Sit with the pain and discomfort instead of resorting to addictions , tv, venting to friends<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We practice Radical Acceptance by pausing and then meeting whatever is happening inside us with this kind of unconditional friendliness<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Bow to the experience<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- “Inviting <i>Mara</i> to tea”: say yes to pain in leg, blaming thoughts, sneezes, irritation, gloomy gray sky<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Saying yes doesn’t mean acting on our harmful impulses and approving of angry thoughts <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The truth about our childhood is stored in our body<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- In both Buddhist psychologists and western experiential therapy this process of experiencing and accepting the changing stream of sensations is central to the alchemy of transformation <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Emotions is a combination of physical sensation and the stories we tell ourselves <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- Layers of historic hurt, fear, or anger may begin to play themselves out in the light of awareness <br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- The cure for pain is in the pain- Rumi<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />- We often think freedom from desire would take the fun out of life.

  Verity is ofcourse a Colleen Hoover classic recommended to anyone trying to find a steamy thriller to read. The book doesn't feel like as much of a page turner as advertised until page 60ish which is when it turns into <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler on goodreads)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ a book within a book--(pay attention to chapter numbers and font going forward)  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>. After that it really picks up speed and I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I took 1 star away because I didn't like the ending. It was confusing and unconvincing which in itself sort of reveals which side of the <i> hashtag CoHort </i> debate I am on for this one. <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler on goodreads)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ I am Team Manuscript  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>. Given that books like <i> Gone Girl </i> and <i> Simple Favor </i> got me into the genre, some of the twists were expected which made me anticipate a very different ending. In my head a better ending would have been if <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler on goodreads)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ Jeremy did all of this to get Verity's life insurance money (like in Simple Favor) and tweaked the manuscript to incriminate her, so that he could run away with a new woman Lowen who is less successful as he grew envious of his wife's success  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book that stood out to me: <br /><br /><blockquote><br />“He’s handsome, but there is something about him that makes me think he wishes he weren’t. Almost as if his looks might be an inconvenience to him. A part of him he doesn’t want anyone to notice, He wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me”<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><br />You seek people like you…people worse off than you…and you use them to make yourself feel better about the terrible things that have happened to you<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />...lipstick so red, its a little jarring at nine thirty in the morning<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />Such an ass. He’s good in bed, like most assholes<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />The richer you are, the more creative you’re able to be<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />An autobiography encouraging the reader to like the author is not a true autobiography.

  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6740757651">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  This is a cute rom-com read, featuring a bit of enemies-to-friends and will-they/won’t-they tension between two neighbors who eventually end up together. The outcome is evident from the cover, so there are no surprises there, but it’s still interesting to witness their romantic journey, complemented by various story arcs and auxiliary plots.<br /><br /><br />This is 2/20 book I got at a book fair, and I’d say its tad spooky, how each book I picked just happened to have found me at the right time, sort of mirroring my present/recent circumstances. Jack is an aspiring actor, <s> and as much as I am hesitant to make everything about myself in these reviews</s> (no more unnecessary apologizing, self-deprecating in 2024, my blog, my review, my choice), his unconventional career path resonated with my own situation at the time of reading.<br /><br />While I’m not pursuing a career in the arts, being the first-generation corporate/office-working woman in my family, struggling a bit in my career but maintaining a strong resolve to continue, made it comforting to see someone fight for what they want.<br /><br />It’s challenging to explain this to my teacher friends, as I don’t intend to demean their profession, but when Jack’s father suggested a stable, low-risk career option, I felt a secondhand fury when Jack yelled, “I do NOT want to be a teacher!” Similar propositions to become a teacher (and/or wife) had recently been made to me as well. Wanting to be a STEM tech corporate professional as a woman had started to feel like begging for yet another chance to audition for a toothpaste commercial, as I tackled another case study interview, only to be disappointed.<br /><br />But like Jack, I know the show must go on. Consistency is key. Sooner or later, you’ll reap the rewards of your passion and labor.<br /><br />The book also sheds light on how our early family dynamics and adolescent relationships influence our adult romantic choices. The characters are well-rounded, making for an enjoyable read.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a thought-provoking, juicy twist, or life-changing type of read, this might not be the book for you. But if you’re just getting back into reading or have time to kill during an airport layover and want an easy, fun read, <i>Sorry I Missed You</i> should prove enjoyable.

  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6710929268">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  This book is very similar to <b> Ego is The Enemy </b>, in terms of structure and writing style, in the sense that each chapter presents an anecdote of someone from ancient times and the lesson we can derive from them. The book contains many inspiring quotes but it also points to how life currently is very easy due to all the tech advancements and other conveniences we have at our disposal, which make us soft, and none of us are going on war or to space like the people detailed in this book, yet they were able to turn their obstacle into catalyst of success, so why can’t we?<br /><br />A narrative like this is what discouraged me from giving this book a full 5 star because it makes the book less relatable and applicable to "cushy modern life"(author's words) as we know it now. This is why I prefer to listen to people like the author Ryan Holiday as a guest at podcasts of other modern day motivational people, like <i>Mark Manson</i>, or <i>Ali Abdaal</i> who help translate teachings of this stoicism in an applicable form into everyday problems in the fortunately (or unfortunately) ’comfortable’ life we currently live.<br /><br /><br />Nonetheless I feel I’d revisit this book, especially some quotes, during personal challenges. Following are some of them: <br /><br /><blockquote> Our actions may be impeded, but there is no impeding our intentions and dispositions… </blockquote><br /><blockquote> If an unjust prison sentence can be not only salvaged but transformative and beneficial, then for our purposes, nothing we’ll experience is likely without potential benefit </blockquote><br /><blockquote> [new strategy to feel less intimidated/insecure by an opponent] picture them having sex (<— never heard of this one, I heard more about picturing someone naked) </blockquote><br /><blockquote> Give yourself clarity, not sympathy </blockquote><br /><blockquote> Blessings and burdens are not mutual exclusive </blockquote><br /><blockquote> Genius often really is just persistence in disguise </blockquote><br /><blockquote> You don’t convince people by challenging them on their longest and most firmly held opinions </blockquote>

  <b> tl;dr : good book, but nothing I haven't heard before </b><br /><br />I am not a huge fan of self help books because I believe most of them re-iterate intrinsic knowledge we all already possess that is hard to implement. Nonetheless getting reminded of these very obvious facts in a 160 page book form does serve as a pick-me-up which is why I'd say this is worth a read.<br /><br />It is well known, especially in the mental health community that not all our thoughts are helpful, but its also hard to filter out which to listen to v/s which to discard/brush off.<br /><br />I think in that regard a good fiction is more helpful- like getting lost in a very engrossing mystery/thriller or even a cute chick lit, than reading a non-fiction <i>gyaan</i> book. <br /><br />This book begins with a paragraph that says <br /><br /><blockquote> "this book was written to help you find everything you’ve been searching for and all answers to all the questions you’ve had your entire life"</blockquote> - to which my intial reaction was ***eyeroll***<br /><br />Then some very generic quotes - change is the only constant, pain is inevitable, suffering is optional, yada yada<br /><br />The concept of us choosing familiar hell v/s unfamiliar heaven, which is listed in many psychology / buddhism books I have read in past<br /><br />The concept of thought v/s thinking - was one slightly new thing in this book, stating former is helpful, but latter is not.<br /><br /><blockquote> “Thought creates, thinking destroys” </blockquote><br /><br /><b>Inspiration driven goals v/s desperation driven goals </b> - chapter is also interesting <br /><br />The book posed an interesting question to help identify inspiration driven goals by asking - <br /><br /><blockquote>
    <br />
    <b>“if you have infinite money, already traveled the world, had no fear, and didnt receive any recognition for what you do, what would you do or what would you create?” </b>
    <br />
  </blockquote><br /><br />I had no good answer for this question (yet)- I guess I could have said my reading, art or my blog, but even that, I feel I do for recognition if I had to be honest, perhaps, because I feel my work is incomplete until I don't share each new blog post on all my social media channels - linkedIn, instagram, etc<br /><br />The book talks about the importance of having an <b>activation ritual </b>- fancy name for morning routine that helps you get in <b><i>mushin </i> </b> state (Japanese concept for non-thinking and being in the zone/flow) <br /><br />One very important teaching that I will practice in my everyday life that came from this book is: <br /><br />to rely on intuition instead of asking 10 million people for advice, sending them screenshots, pros n cons, yay and nay list, prior to making any professional or personal decision. I feel not only do we waste our( and our friends’) time, but we are just confusing ourselves because deep down we know the answer and are just looking for confirmation from other people, which could be a sign of under-confidence<br /><br />This also reminded of a quote by Ram Dass <b>“your own soul is your guru, quiet the mind and listen to your higher self”</b><br /><br />Also it says<br /><blockquote><b> “society will almost never confirm your intuition until its mainstream already. For this reason, if you try to look outside for confirmation on what you know to be true for you, you’ll almost always get backlash and differing opinions on what next steps you should take. Hence avoid looking externally for answers. Follow your intuition, your gut feeling, your inner wisdom, and the Universe/God"</b> </blockquote><br />(pg 112)<br /><br />At this point the book started becoming more spiritual than just self-help, which is why I’d say I enjoyed the ending more than the beginning. He also refers to Universe as<i> “Her”</i> (*cue Arianna Grande’s God is a Woman) and also talks about his relationship with his wife which was sweet.<br /><br />Towards the end the author does the summary of his book himself and asks the reader for a amazon rating and also provides his dot org email if anyone wants to share anything with him.<br /><br />All in all decent read but I’d re-iterate, for me to personally get into this state of <i>mushin</i>( non-thinking/no ruminating), a really good fiction-mystery/thriller does a way better job in terms of serving as a good break/distraction on days I am stressed about a project in my day job, than a non fiction self help book.

  This book really didn't do it for me interms of giving me hands-on techniques on how to unleash the power of NOW. I picked up this book at a time when I was waiting for an important email reply, and I guess instead of checking my gmail app @ 2x per 30 mins, this book helped me reduce that to once per hour. Other than that there is nothing special about it. Of course it highlights the importance of being in the now, basically stating how 9 times out of 10 the life situation that is bothering us right now has nothing to do with what’s happening in this moment, but either dwelling on past or worrying about an anticipated future event. yes ok, but the suggestions made on how to come out of this feel very easier said that done and the kind of lines that would get you an eye-roll if quoted in a normal conversation. <br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, I am not exceptionally skeptical, or against what people call <i>woo-woo</i> spirituality. If anything <i>the Secret</i> was once my holy grail and still ends up being a comfort read during trying times. But this book just didn't have that kind of transformational effect on me as the <i>Oprah</i> quote suggest on the cover of my copy.<br /><br />Perhaps I could revisit this at a later less angsty times in my life and see if it ends up being a thought provoking read then, but for now it was - meh

  I hate to give such a poor rating to a book based on DV and inspired by Author's personal story but this book is insufferable. I started reading it way before I discovered about the movie adaptation. I liked reading <i>Verity</i> earlier this year and thought this seems like a good 2nd CH book to dive into... but alas I was wrong. Maybe this would have been more appealing to me had I been a teenager but as a woman in 30s this book had me eyerolling and cringeing until pg 120ish, which is when I decided to give up. Everything from the letters to Ellen diary entries to Ryle's overtly sexual fuckboi red flag vibes from the get-go had me barfing. I resumed reading now that the trailer and Blake Lively press and promotions vids are all over my feed but again could only get up until pg 214, which is when I called it quits again. <br /><br />I read the plot on wiki to get closure and may or may not watch the movie.<br /><br />Was really trying to end the trend of reading only 2/3rds of a book this year and was going pretty strong up until this one
