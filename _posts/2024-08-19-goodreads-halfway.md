Reading is such a joyful and meditative activity, but it also reminded me how real the concept of inertia from physics classes is—a body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion stays in motion. My reading inertia was broken when I visited a book fair—or rather, a book buffet, if you will—where I could fill a box with as many books as I wanted (I got 20). That experience reignited my reading journey.
