Little America is a show about immigrants living in America and their struggles. Its on Apple TV and I only watched the first episode('The Manager') because I only had the free trial till end of the year and I wasn't compelled to pay for the rest of the season.

That doesn't mean that its not a good show - I'm just trying to budget a little, hehe.

The first episode is a story about an Indian family running a motel(classic!). All episodes are _Sachi kahani se prerit_(based on true events). There is a kid named Kabir who 'manages' the motel when his parents are not around. Typical first generation over-achiever Indian kid- spelling bees, dictionaries, and all. It's giving _Devi Vishwakumar_. The dictionary scene reminded me of my mom because even she was really into learning english and like SAT words and she taught me to do the same.

The show is directed by _Kumail Nanjiani_ so I am not surprised that first episode was about a desi family. It's a very desi episode- kajraare, cricket,TV serials, and all.

The show sheds light on how much of a shitshow American immigration system is. I have been through this, omg, I still get ptsd when someone says _h1b_ or _green card_.
The kid gets separated from his parents because they can't get asylum so they have to move back to India. The replacement manager is a dick. DHS and immigration scenes give me the heebie jeebies. The kid trys everything to get reunited with his parents - writing letters to the goverment, visiting the white house after winning the spelling bee, etc

I didn't realize the kid was going to grow up to be so cute and be played by actor _Suraj Sharma_(Life of Pi, Wedding Season(netlfix), How I met your father(disney plus)). One night he invites people over for a party, gets too drunk and high, and starts dancing desi style to non-desi tunes. Such a cutie!

The boy finally reunites with his parents AFTER YEARS. The love for fried chicken and airport scene hit too close to home.

I may get Apple TV subsription in future to watch the rest of the series.

If you're looking for fun bollywood tunes, heartwarming story about Indian immigrants in America, watch this show/episode.
