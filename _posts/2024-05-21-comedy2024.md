### What's been up in the comedy world?
As you might know I am super passionate about standup comedy. It has helped me so much! See my [**previous post about comedy to understand how**]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %}). Although this post may explain what got me into comedy and how I have gravitated towards comedians who do self-deprecating or mental health related material, for the sake of my personal health and wellbeing I also had to make some conscious adjustments in what kind of comedy(or any kind of content in general) I consume. 

I started becoming aware of a phenomenon of being overtly cynical, self-deprecating myself due to the kind of content I consumed. And why shouldn't I? That is what sells and seems to be _in_ right now. It was also what was taught to me to be the foundation of my own comedy career. I remember while taking comedy classes in San Francisco, our first assignment was to list down all things that make us mad/confused/upset about the world as you can see below:

While I had a lot of fun with this, I feel this can be a slippery slope leading to one becoming trauma dump-ey, nihilist, oversharer, and an overall negative person who romanticizes pain and depression. Atleast that was the turn it took for me, which is why I have been very mindful of what I consume, how I rate, and separate the art from the artist, and the wittiness from the objectivity of a stance shared by my favorite comics. I believe that will be evident in my review of my top 2024 standups below

###  Taylor Tomlinson: Have It All

Taylor is pretty funny and also made the list in my [**top standups of 2024**]({% post_url 2022-11-27-comedy_2 %}). While her last special was more mental health oriented, this is more about pushing 30s and the pressures that come with it, especially the pressure to _find your person_ and settle down. She compared her life to that of her married friends and how each side had a perspective to lend to the other.

    <summary> click to reveal my favorite bits - that are also sort of spoilers </summary>
    
*  comparing _dating yourself_ to _going on a walk without headphones_ bit
*   speaking of having to trade-off in life for it be fair. As in saying no one should be allowed to have both their dream job AND their soulmate...if they do their parents better be divorced or dead. 
    This was clever writing but I wasn't very fond of it, because as I said in the intro, I am trying to be very mindful of what I consume, because I inadvertantly end up thinking of comics as sort of life coaches and demi-gods since I find this form of art to be very impressive and since comics are known to _keep it real_, but that can be harmful and at the end of the day these just mere mortals like you and me, so their _epiphanies_ should be taken with a grain of salt (something I totally forgot!)
* _Dating app date is not a blind date, but definitely
  a near-sighted one_ bit
