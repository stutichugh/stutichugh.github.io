### What's been up in the comedy world?
As you might know I am super passionate about standup comedy. It has helped me so much! See my [**previous post about comedy to understand how**]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %}). Although this post may explain what got me into comedy and how I have gravitated towards comedians who do self-deprecating or mental health related material, for the sake of my personal health and wellbeing I also had to make some conscious adjustments in what kind of comedy(or any kind of content in general) I consume. 

I started becoming aware of a phenomenon of being overtly cynical, self-deprecating myself due to the kind of content I consumed. And why shouldn't I? That is what sells and seems to be _in_ right now. It was also what was taught to me to be the foundation of my own comedy career. I remember while taking comedy classes in San Francisco, our first assignment was to list down all things that make us mad/confused/upset about the world as you can see below:

While I had a lot of fun with this, I feel this can be a slippery slope leading to one becoming trauma dump-ey, nihilist, oversharer, and an overall negative person who romanticizes pain and depression. Atleast that was the turn it took for me, which is why I have been very mindful of what I consume, how I rate, and separate the art from the artist, and the wittiness from the objectivity of a stance shared by my favorite comics. I believe that will be evident in my review of my top 2024 standups below

### My Top 3 Netflix Specials of 2024

### Taylor Tomlinson: Have It All(Netlfix)
![taylor]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/taylorhaveitalll.jpg)

Taylor is pretty funny and also made the list in my [**top standups of 2024**]({% post_url 2022-11-27-comedy_2 %}). While her last special was more mental health oriented, this is more about pushing 30s and the pressures that come with it, especially the pressure to _find your person_ and settle down. She compared her life to that of her married friends and how each side had a perspective to lend to the other.

    <uL>
        <li>comparing <i>dating yourself</i> to <i>going on a walk without headphones</i> bit 
        </li>
        <li>speaking of having to trade-off in life for it be fair. As in saying no one should be allowed to have both their dream job AND their soulmate...if they do their parents better be divorced or dead. 
            <ul>
            <li>
                This was clever writing but I wasn't very fond of it, because as I said in the intro, I am trying to be very mindful of what I consume, because I inadvertently end up thinking of comics as sort of life coaches and demi-gods since I find this form of art to be very impressive and since comics are known to <i>keep it real</i>, but that can be harmful and at the end of the day as these art just mere mortals like you and me, so their <i>epiphanies</i> should be taken with a grain of salt (something I totally forgot!)
            </li>
            </ul>

        <li> <i>Dating app date is not a blind date, but definitely a near-sighted one </i> bit

        <li> <i>this isnt model squad - its personality squad</i> bit- again, funny bit but not a fan of this limiting belief that you can be just either/or 
        </li>
        <li> Jabs married people and the single squad take at each other as they simultaneously pity and envy the other party:
            <ul>
            <li> <b>Single to Married</b>:  "yeah but you're married so its fine that you had to work 60 hours. You have your dream dick" 
            </li>
            <li> <b>Married to Single </b>: "Yeah I'd probably focus on work too if I were alone" 
            </li>
            <li> <b>Single to Married </b>: "Yeah I'd probably have a bunch of kids too if I had no talent"

### Neal Brennan: Crazy Good (Netflix)
![Neal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nbcg.jpg)

Neal is one of the wittiest comedy writers out there and also made the list in my [**top standups of 2024**]({% post_url 2022-11-27-comedy_2 %}). All his specials are mental health heavy or <i>Traumedy </i> as he likes to call it; which is ironic because he pokes fun of women who talk about their trauma journey in his new special <i> Crazy Good </i>. His takes are quite impressionable and have had huge impact on me but he was also on the list of my artists who romanticize pain/depression I need to avoid in 2024. I inadvertently end up quoting him to sound smart in conversations, only to end up sounding more depressed than I actually have ever been. Also the whole depression-is-a-thing-for-smart-ovrthinkers narrative can be a harmful one to have. 

Nonetheless he is a great comedy writer so he makes this list.

Nonetheless interesting writing/observations)

###  Nikki Glaser: Someday You'll Die (HBO)
![Nikki]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nikkisomeday.jpg)

And last but definitely not the least, NIKKI GLASER!!!üòç I think this was expected to make the list as I am someone who often makes knowing and [having met Nikki]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %}#nikki-glaser) my whole personality-lol. Nikki has been the belle of the ball in the comedy world lately due to her massive success off of the <i> The Roast of Tom Brady </i>. Like any and every <i>Bestie</i> I have been so happy for her and been watching and listening to every interview and podcast appearance she has made since. On top of that, She came out with her 3rd special _Someday You'll Die_ on HBO max. This ironic Mother's Day release talks about her pushing 40s and still not wanting to have kids, struggles of being an aging woman in Hollywood, her challenging the idea of monogamy, and finding relief in the concept of death. As always it is pretty raunchy and not for everyone. Even I got uncomfortable at some points, but having said that I have already watched it 5 times.
