I have been Ali Abdaal’s fan since I started this blog. Actually he may be one of the reasons I started this blog. One 20 minute Ali video could inspire upto 10 hours of much creativity and productivity in me so I thought how great would it be if I got his book - Feel Good Productivity and use it to do some goal/life resetting for the new year 2024.

Here are my favorite takeaways from the book (along with some personal tangents, if you’re so inclined to learn about my life lately…)

Feeling Good boosts our productivity and making work “fun” via incorporating one(or more) of the 8 play personalities makes you more productive
Up until I was 16, I was able to naturally incorporate this (or any) of the ‘theories’  listed in this book in my life as they are intuitive and helped me greatly succeed academically but to some level I lost these and have to time and again rewire my brain to think like this again It shouldn’t come as a surprise that when we have good hormones(endorphins, serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin) they boost our energy, hence our productivity. 

The 8 play personalities are 

Finding joy in the process instead of the outcome leads to better results. This is something he emphasized in his recent YT video as well, calling it the “arrival” fallacy. Wherein he explains that we delay pleasure or wait to enjoy life until we “arrive” at an arbitrary destination instead of enjoying the journey
Reframe failures as “data points” we need to figure out how to succeed. We are often hugely disproportionately impacted by negative consequences - even arbitrary ones. 
Confidence is a learned habit. You have to kind of cosplay your way into it. 
“When going gets tough, those who believed they could do it- regardless of their ability were the onws who actually could
Intrinsic motivation > Extrinsic motivation 
Intrinsic (self fulfillment, curiosity & learning, personal growth)
Extrinsic (rewards & punishments, social approval, performance goals)
Power and autonomy leads to better productivity. Saying I “have to” do this task (which is coercive language that makes you feel powerless) , instead say I “choose to” do this task(which is autonomy affirming language that makes you feel more powerful)
Unblock method > discipline method > motivation method 
Procrastination is caused by negative feelings like confusion,fear, interia
We need to find courage to beat fear but looking at it, acknowledging it, and moving past it
Identity Label: this is the most impactful chapter for me:
Labels that society places on us profoundly affect the way we behave
Labels become a SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
His way: in moments of self doubt, the label he looks for is lifelong learner
Beat catastrophizing by reframing the same situation so that we feel better emotionally
10/10/10 rule: viewing setbacks as temporary small hiccup
Self confidence equation = perception of our ability - perception of standards
Batman effect - same as identity label- give yourself a alter ego name who would have no trouble doing a daunting like(like beyonce’s sasha fierce)
Forgive yourself for guilt and shame for making mistakes or procrastinating 
Distraction is a temporary veering off track- not an indication that it’s time to abandon your plans altogether
Schedule “do nothing” breaks in your calendar as breaks aren’t a special treat, they are an absolute necessity
