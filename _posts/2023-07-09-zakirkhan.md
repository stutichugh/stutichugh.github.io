Zakir Khan has been showing up on my reels a bunch so I thought I will finally pick a Saturday and watch his prime special. I think he is witty but loses momentum towards the end. Nonetheless there were some very good punchlines and observations.

The most relatable bit that initially attracted me to the special was him giving women's perspective when it comes to liking a boy:
_apna lowest hit kar jati hai_ , and then they snap, _iska ab hogya_🙅 *hairflip* 💁 haha 

Here are my other favs:

* The bit about unrequited love: _you win and lose everyday_
* Cricket fandom of boys bit
* Women _no kajal look_ bit was funny. It reminded me of a girl in my high school who used to say _mera kajal nahi hai, meri aankhein naturally aisi hain_ lmao
* The bit about those papa ki pari girls : _mujhe cooking aati hai, embroidery bhi aati hai, aur papa ki pari toh mai hun hi_ 🙋😌
* Men using all the right _keywords_ post a woman's breakup: 'totally', 'of course', 'kya ghatiya insaan hai'
* Men's inner monologue v/s outer monologue : while speaking to a girl
* Was also nice to see a brown man admit that they are emotionally immature because of the whole archaic hunter v/s gatherer thing: _emotion ke maamle Mei 400 saal peeeche reh gaye_
* The bit about how poetic women can get when in love
* _phone pe suna dena book_ bit: it reminded me of my long convos with my friend Shambhavi who would listen to me narrate a whole psych thriller novel to her (we still do that over phone lol)
* Women making men admit to their BS bit was also very good. _bhai tera legend but bhaabhi mega legend_

It was cute to see him say that all of dating is pretty much trial and error. 

Overall good vibes
