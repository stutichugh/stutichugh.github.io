	I'm an analyst, a traveller, a self-proclaimed comedian, a serial binge-watcher, and a creative person. I love reading, working with data, psychology, and finding ways to merge all my passions and interests into one(like I try with this blog ;)<br>
		I created this website to share my experiences and stories about travelling and living in different countries. I also use this space to share my love for comedy, TV shows, and books by sharing reviews and recommendations. <br>
		This website may also feature some of my personal projects within the analytics domain. <br>

		Hope y'all enjoy peeking into my world via this blog...:)
