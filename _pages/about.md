	I'm a data analyst, a traveller, a self-proclaimed comedian, a serial binge-watcher, and a creative person. I love reading, working with data, psychology, and finding ways to merge all my passions and interests into one(like I try with this blog)<br>
	<i>Stutiphanies</i> was the name coined by me in my standup days to share my comedic observations, that I thought would also someday be the name of my Netflix special (haha); but over the years I have learned that I am more comfortable being a comedy writer than a perfomer, which is why I decided to rebrand this blog as <i>Stutiphanies</i> aka <b>Stuti's epiphanies</b>. <br>

	Everything starting from something as small as a funny phrase in one of these posts to as big as the inception of this blog, the idea of hosting it on GitHub pages to show off things I learned in my CompSci classes/Girls Who Code days, using Jekyll to do the design (to show off a new skill I learned during covid)- all of it can be thought of as a low to mid-tier epiphany of mine. Hence the decision to not reserve the name stutiphanies for a future standup special or a coffee shop I may or may not ending up owning, and use it instead of this blog.<br>

	I created Stutiphanies to share my experiences and stories about travelling and living in different countries. I also use this space to share my love for comedy, TV shows, and books by sharing reviews and recommendations. <br>
	Stutiphanies may also feature some of my personal projects within the analytics domain. <br>

	Hope y'all enjoy peeking into my world via this blog...:)
